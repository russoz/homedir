Etiquette Icons - 0.6

Etiquette Icons are Scalable Vector Graphic icons for the GNOME desktop.

They:
-	are Scalable
-	completley use the gnome 32 colour palette..  
	 (yeah its a bid foggy but ill do what i can.)
-	follow the Human Interface Guidelines 
	 ( dont have any text in mimetype icons etc )
- 	look nice enough for me and maybe for you too


( one of these days I'll change to a proper versioning system use a roadmap... )
