This is my first metacity theme and was greatly inspired by the
Windowblinds skin Dark Aqua XP found at wincustomize.com.
It was a long time favoeite on mine and I hope the linux
community enjoys it as much as I do. I use it with the
Aero gtk theme with a black bg.png (included in the same
directory this README is) instead of the default bg.png.
I hope to make a matching GTK-Aqua-Dark-X theme as well.

Many thanks to carrett and xenonmiii. They did all the real work.

Hope you enjoy it!
