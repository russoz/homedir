this is pretty much the Aqua LightBlue theme, for gtk1 but with new artwork - and some small mods to the config file.
thanks to all who have worked on the themes it is based on.

  This theme is simply a color modification of the very nice
  AquaGrape theme. Thanks to Tony.
  I don't know if this LightBlue is a real Apple color. But it
  looks more eye-friendly to me than the original Grape.

  This theme is based on an older version of Eric's Aqua clone.  
All I did was change the pixmaps to purple.

  Oh yeah, Apple, I don't think you can sue me.  Can you say "fair use"?
I knew that you could :)

  The original README is below, right after the extra thanks.

<< Eric's Orignal README >>

Hi all,

This is my first gtk theme.  It's a poor way to emulate Mac OSX UI.
This theme probably can be improved with rounded buttons, if someone
makes a better pixmap engine with anti-aliases, alpha binding, and static
positioning of smaller pixmap.  If no one write it, you can hope I
will find the time to do it.   I hope someone would do it before I
figure out gtk.

Since some of the pictures are captured from Apple Mac OSX screenshot,
I am not qualify to say that all data goes under GPL License.  Ask
lawyers near you.

Special thanks to frantzdb, who created original gtk-x theme.  He did a
good job copy Mac OSX's scroller, and I copied his scroller.

Apple, please don't sue me.

regards,
AADA (eric@simweb.com)
