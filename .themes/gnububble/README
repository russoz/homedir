gnububble v0.4  by Kyle Davis (kyled@blueriver.net)
===================================================

My first GTK+-2.0 theme.
It is based off of bluebubble and
ideas from AquaGraphite (GTK+-1.2 theme)

This theme is meant to give an Aqua
feel to things without being another clone.

v0.3:

 other misc. random fixes

v0.2:
