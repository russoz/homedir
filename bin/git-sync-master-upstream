# This script will automate some steps for a developer working on a forked
# git repository:
#
#     1. Pull (and merge) changes from origin into master
#     2. Fetch changes from upstream
#     3. Merge upstream changes with master
#
# There is no dependency on github, but, as of now, the
# repository names are hard-coded as reasonably as::
#
# - upstream: the original repo from where you forked
# - origin: your forked repository
# - master: your local working copy
#
#     usage: git-sync-master-upstream [<upstream-url>]
#
# The <upstream-url> is only necessary the first time
# git-sync-master-upstream is run. Next time it is run, simply call
# 'git-sync-master-upstream'.
#
# The merging procedure with the upstream repository was learned from:
#
#     http://help.github.com/forking/
