# This script will return the list of the BlueGroups to which a user
# (specified by his intranet ID) belongs.
#
# This script is also available at the intranet address:
# http://pokgsa.ibm.com/~alexeiz/public/bin/listBlueGroups
#
# This script requires ldapsearch from openldap package and perl.
#
# It has been tested on Linux, but it should work fine on other systems
# with minor modifications.
